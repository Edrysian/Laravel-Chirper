# My Notes

---

## The following needs to begin in a powershell terminal to work

* `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`
  * To start the server on localhost
* `npm run dev`
  * To start VITE

This turns the terminal from powershell to the relevant language. PHP for the first command, node for the second.

Remember to have another terminal open to run php commands.
Remember to have another terminal open to run git commands.
