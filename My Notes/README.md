# My Notes

---

## The following needs to begin in a powershell terminal to work

* `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`
  * To start the server on localhost
* `npm run dev`
  * To start VITE
* `php artisan tinker`
  * To execute PHP code in the application.
  * `exit` to escape from tinker.
* `npm artisan queue:work`
  * To start the connection between Chirper and Mailtip.

This turns the terminal from powershell to the relevant language. PHP for the first command, node for the second.

* Remember to have another terminal open to run php commands.
* Remember to have another terminal open to run git commands.

## Other Notes
